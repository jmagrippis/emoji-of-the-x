			We created <strong>Emoji of the X</strong> to inspire creators looking to find a spark through
			creativity, through limitation!
		</p>
		<p>
			Weâ€™d be delighted if you used the emoji of the day as the theme of your photograph, or TikTok,
			or workout, or yoga practice... or anything, really! You can even let us know of the results
